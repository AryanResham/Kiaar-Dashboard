What’s Left for Your ML Workflow
Backend:

Update /api/map/coordinates to:
Send req.body to your ML model API (using fetch or axios).
Store the ML model’s response in the IndexesData collection.
Create a new endpoint (e.g., /api/map/results) to fetch processed data for a user or query.
Frontend:

Update  dashboard components to:
Send user input to /api/map/coordinates.
Fetch and display processed data from /api/map/results.
General:

Add error handling, loading states, and user feedback.
(Optional) Add authentication checks for protected routes.
Would you like me to start by implementing the backend changes for the ML workflow? If yes, please provide the ML model API endpoint and expected response format, or I can use a placeholder.
